Our Idea & Website

We’ve built a website (with an app coming soon) that makes it easy for patients to connect with doctors. Our platform provides detailed doctor profiles, including their expertise, ratings, and available appointment slots. We carefully verify each doctor to ensure quality service. Patients can book appointments seamlessly through our platform.

Beyond just appointments, we also offer post-diagnosis care—patients can request medicine delivery, home blood tests, or even a nurse to assist them at home after their diagnosis.
The Problem We Are Solving

We are tackling two major healthcare challenges:

    Eliminating the hassle of booking appointments – No more standing in long queues; patients can now book appointments from the comfort of their homes.

    Ensuring availability of home healthcare services – Many patients, especially the elderly, require assistance after diagnosis. Whether it’s getting an injection, managing medications, or requiring general nursing care, we connect them with trusted nurses. Additionally, we make it easy to get medicines delivered or blood tests done at home.

How It Works, Revenue Model & Future Goals

Our platform builds a network of trusted doctors and nurses, helping patients connect with them effortlessly.
Revenue Model

    We earn a commission from doctors for each appointment booked through our platform.

    Patients, nurses, and medical service providers (e.g., pharmacies, labs) pay a small fee for post-diagnosis care services.

Future Goals

In the long run, we aim to expand our services further. If a patient needs medical treatment in another city, we will plan their entire trip, including appointments, accommodation, and transportation—partnering with healthcare providers and travel services to make this happen while earning commissions.
